# Shoplist DeBot

Author: Alim Sadetov

### General information

The debots and the smart-contract are located in the folder [contracts](./contracts).
To complicate the project, it was decided to divide one Debot into two Debots, each with slightly different functions.
The [code](./contracts/abstractDebot.sol) of the abstract debot has also been implemented.
The code of the smart-contract itself: [link](./contracts/shoplist.sol)
