## Info
This series of smart contracts is designed to practice writing OOP in Solidity. It is a game where two players can have two units, each of which can attack enemy units. 
The units interact through an interface, and abstract contracts are also implemented in the code for easy understanding of the code.

## Usage
Deploy smart contracts via node js.
```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
